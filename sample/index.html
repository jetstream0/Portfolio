          <p></p>
          <p>A fun game using the new Discord bot interactions API. Made for a NFT project on Algorand, and includes an internal currency system, role system, and NFT counter. Oh, and cool graphs too!</p>
          <div class="sample-quote">
            <p>"Prussia helped me get my entire gameified Discord idea up and running. He started from scratch helping me create discord bots that would not only give out free tokens to players, but real NFTs on the Algorand blockchain as well, along with countless other operational commands and features. His understanding of how to get things done as a developer allow me to have crazy ideas -- and they actually work! He's super easy to work with as well, and has great ideas of his own. 10/10"</p>

      //todo: add avatar faucet
      //Prussia is an absolutely amazing developer and I couldn’t recommend him enough!  I approached Prussia with an idea to create a faucet to help an entire community. Despite him having a lot of work, he was able to create the faucet with a turnaround time that vastly exceeded my expectations! He made everything super simple and straightforward.  He was always available to correct design changes. When we tested the faucet, we only found 1 bug (incredible on the first attempt) and it was corrected within an hour. He continually followed up to make sure everything was working, and while everything was operating flawlessly, I appreciate the consistent communication. If I had another project, I would hire Prussia immediately and would recommend him to anyone.
