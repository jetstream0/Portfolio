          <p>A fun game using the new Discord bot interactions API. Made a NFT project on Algorand, and includes an internal currency system, role system, and NFT counter.</p>

            <p>"Prussia helped me get my entire gameified Discord idea up and running. He started from scratch helping me create discord bots that would not only give out free tokens to players, but real NFTs on the Algorand blockchain as well, along with countless other operational commands and features. His understanding of how to get things done as a developer allow me to have crazy ideas -- and they actually work! He's super easy to work with as well, and has great ideas of his own. 10/10"</p>

            <p>"I reached out to Prussia after encountering his work on other crypto faucets. I brought him my vision for a personalized, embeddable faucet widget to place in my web storeâ€”having virtually no programming knowledge myself. <b>Prussia managed to realize my idea to a tee at an impressive pace</b>, handling both frontend and backend work for the site, and guiding me along when necessary. I hope to cooperate with this highly capable individual again!"</p>
