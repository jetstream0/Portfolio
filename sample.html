          <p>A fun game using the new Discord bot interactions API. Made a NFT project on Algorand, and includes an internal currency system, role system, and NFT counter.</p>
          <div class="sample-quote">
            <p>"Prussia helped me get my entire gameified Discord idea up and running. He started from scratch helping me create discord bots that would not only give out free tokens to players, but real NFTs on the Algorand blockchain as well, along with countless other operational commands and features. His understanding of how to get things done as a developer allow me to have crazy ideas -- and they actually work! He's super easy to work with as well, and has great ideas of his own. 10/10"</p>
