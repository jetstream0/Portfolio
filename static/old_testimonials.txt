            <p>I had been using his Banano faucet previously and reached out to him asking if he could make a faucet for me, <b>he went above and beyond and I'm extremely happy with the results</b>. He's been helpful and explained everything to me. As of now the announcement post is <b>N°1 in Hot in r/Cryptocurrency</b> with the comments on it being <b>overwhelmingly positive</b>, everyone I've talked to has mentioned him and his faucets in a positive light.</p>

            <p><span class="quote"><b>“</b></span>I wasn't sure whether to transfer money to a stranger for a service that I couldn't 'Cashback' at first. You've shifted my perspective on individuals on the internet. For the past year and a half, you've been a business associate, helping me with my various demands on Discord. You have provided me with <b>loyalty, trust, and prompt results</b> since the beginning. All of the goods you've created for me have functioned <b>flawlessly</b> and are reasonably priced. I couldn't ask for a better associate!</p>

            <p><span class="quote"><b>“</b></span>Prussia was kind enough to release his faucet code on Github for others to fork. When I hit a brick wall in my own technical abilities, Prussia graciously stepped in to take over the task of launching the fork for me. He is <b>very professional and responsive, and completed the task way faster than I ever expected</b>. I will definitely be hiring Prussia again to make additional fun enhancements to the faucet in the near future. Users are already loving this instance of the banano faucet!</p>

            <p><span class="quote"><b>“</b></span>Prussia is an amazing person to work with. I found some of their code(which is freely available to anyone) I was interested in and didn’t have the capabilities to set it up myself. We agreed on a quote upfront and I have a feeling it turned into a longer job than either of us expected. But through all the roadblocks Prussia was patient and put a large amount of time and effort to get the job done and done right. They also offered future support and assistance which is much appreciated. I should also mention most, if not all, roadblocks were due to my specific situation and requests. I would most definitely work with them again if a situation arose that required their skills.</p>

            <p><span class="quote"><b>“</b></span>I reached out to Prussia after encountering his work on other crypto faucets. I brought him my vision for a personalized, embeddable faucet widget to place in my web store—having virtually no programming knowledge myself. <b>Prussia managed to realize my idea to a tee at an impressive pace</b>, handling both frontend and backend work for the site, and guiding me along when necessary. I hope to cooperate with this highly capable individual again!</p>

            <p><span class="quote"><b>“</b></span>Prussia helped me get my entire gameified Discord idea up and running. He started from scratch helping me create discord bots that would not only give out free tokens to players, but real NFTs on the Algorand blockchain as well, along with countless other operational commands and features. <b>His understanding of how to get things done as a developer allow me to have crazy ideas -- and they actually work!</b> He's super easy to work with as well, and has great ideas of his own. 10/10</p>

            <p><span class="quote"><b>“</b></span>The reddit bots which Prussia has developed does tasks no single group of humans would ever be able to do. He activates them and they will then continue to produce tens of thousands of comments without any issues at all. I highly recommend them as a tool which will enable your business to do bigger things in a fast, simple and reliable way.</p>

After that I explained to him what I needed, and they immediately got to work. I got everything I wanted, all done within 24hrs. Great service, and gave me exactly what I was looking for! Absolutely recommend!</p>

            <p><span class="quote"><b>“</b></span>Prussia is an absolutely amazing developer and I couldn’t recommend him enough!  I approached Prussia with an idea to create a faucet to help an entire community. Despite him having a lot of work, he was able to create the faucet with a turnaround time that vastly exceeded my expectations! He made everything super simple and straightforward.  He was always available to correct design changes. When we tested the faucet, we only found 1 bug (incredible on the first attempt) and it was corrected within an hour. He continually followed up to make sure everything was working, and while everything was operating flawlessly, I appreciate the consistent communication. If I had another project, I would hire Prussia immediately and would recommend him to anyone.</p>
