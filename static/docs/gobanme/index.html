    <h2 id="what-is-banano">What is Banano?</h2>
    <p>Banano is a decentralized digital currency, also known as a cryptocurrency. Bitcoin and Ether are other examples of cryptocurrencies. Banano is a fork (copy) of another cryptocurrency called Nano, and it inherits its features such as feeless, non energy intensive and quick transactions. It is also easy to aquire and has a friendly community. These inherited attributes make Banano an ideal tipping currency. If you want to know more you can visit <a href="https://banano.cc">Banano's website</a>, <a href="https://chat.banano.cc">discord</a> or <a href="https://reddit.com/r/banano">subreddit</a>. If you want a general view of how cryptocurrencies work, this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBC-nXj3Ng4">video</a> is great.</p>

    <h2 id="extension-install">Extension Install</h2>
    <p>For <b>Mozilla Firefox</b> users, the installation is easy! Simply click the link <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/gobanme/">here</a>, and click the big blue 'Add to Firefox' button. A popup will come up. Read it, and click 'Add'. Then the extension will be installed! Hurrah!</p>
    <p>You can also install it in <b>Google Chrome</b> and other Chromium based browsers such as <b>Microsoft Edge</b>, simply go to the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gobanme/chcpbckfgpcogpgceecknjgcaicdonje">Chrome Webstore Download Page</a> and add it.</p>

    <h2 id="seed">How do I get a Seed?/What is a Seed?</h2>
    <p>The extension requires a seed to use. So what is a seed, and do you get it? First of all, a seed is a bunch of random bits that can generate private keys. It's a bit complex, so think of it as your password to your account, and <b>never, ever show it to anyone, enter it anywhere you do not trust, or lose it.</b> Best practice is to store it in a safe physical location, but if it's too much of a pain for you, at least write it down on your device's notepad or in another location you won't lose or forget. If someone else has your seed, they have control of all your funds. If you lose it, your funds are gone forever.</p>
    <p>Ok, now how do you get one? The easiest way is going to vault.banano.cc and creating a new wallet. The site should give you a seed. If you already have a banano wallet, you should already have a seed. If not, your wallet may have a way to export your seed. It is also possible to programmatically generate a seed, use your nano seed, or use other sites to generate a seed.</p>
    <p>Please feel free to ask people in the Banano discord or subreddit if you need further help.</p>

    <h2 id="use-existing-seed">I already have a seed with some funds. Should I the existing seed?</h2>
    <p>Even if you enter an existing seed with lots of funds, it should be safe and secure (only a version encrypted by your password is stored on your browser), but you shouldn't be risking the safety of your funds by blindly trusting some random extension, so it is <b>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to GENERATE A NEW SEED and send some Bananos to it, instead of using your existing seed</b>.</p>

    <h2 id="get-banano">How do I get Banano?</h2>
    <p>Now that you have a seed, you need some banano to donate. You can get small amounts of free banano using <a href="https://banano.how/where-can-i-get-free-banano/">faucets</a> (faucets are websites that give you small amounts of cryptocurrency). Might I suggest <a href="https://faucet.prussia.dev">mine</a>? You can also participate in the banano community and you will likely recieve banano. In addition, you can buy banano from those who already have some, either through Peer to Peer trading or <a href="https://howtobanano.info/all-current-banano-exchanges-an-updated-overview/">cryptocurrency exchanges</a>.</p>

    <h1 id="permissions">Permissions Needed</h1>
    <h2 id="access-all-data">Access your data for all websites (*://*/*)</h2>
    <p>This permissions sounds pretty scary, but don't worry, we only need this to access the website's banano.json file. The extension does not store or access any of your data or information or any data or information of any websites you accessed, and definetly does not send it anywhere outside your device. The extension is <a href="https://github.com/jetstream0/GoBanMe">open source</a> so you can check if yourself. I am working on a way to not need this permission.</p>

    <h2 id="clipboard-write">Input data to the clipboard (clipboardWrite)</h2>
    <p>This permission is needed to copy the website's banano address to the clipboard. No clipboard data is stored or sent outside of the user's device.</p>

    <h2 id="storage">storage</h2>
    <p>This permission is needed to store an encrypted version of your seed (your seed is encrypted by your password).</p>

    <p>WORK IN PROGRESS</p>

    <h1 id="add-gobanme">Add GoBanMe to Website</h1>
    <p>Adding GoBanMe support your website is simple. Just add a JSON file named banano.json to the root of your website (example.com/banano.json, not example.com/directory/banano.json). The file should look like this:</p>
    <code>
      {
          "author":"",
          "description":"",
          "suggested_donation":"",
          "address": ""
      }
    </code>
    <p>Everything should be a string and it is recommended that suggested_donation be a whole number.</p>
