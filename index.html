He's been helpful and explained everything to me. As of now the announcement post is <b>N°1 in Hot in r/Cryptocurrency</b> with the comments on it being <b>overwhelmingly positive</b>, everyone I've talked to has mentioned him and his faucets in a positive light.</p>

I found some of their code(which is freely available to anyone) I was interested in and didn’t have the capabilities to set it up myself. We agreed on a quote upfront and I have a feeling it turned into a longer job than either of us expected. But through all the roadblocks Prussia was patient and put a large amount of time and effort to get the job done and done right. They also offered future support and assistance which is much appreciated. I should also mention most, if not all, roadblocks were due to my specific situation and requests. I would most definitely work with them again if a situation arose that required their skills.</p>

I approached Prussia with an idea to create a faucet to help an entire community. Despite him having a lot of work, he was able to create the faucet with a turnaround time that vastly exceeded my expectations! He made everything super simple and straightforward.  He was always available to correct design changes. When we tested the faucet, we only found 1 bug (incredible on the first attempt) and it was corrected within an hour. He continually followed up to make sure everything was working, and while everything was operating flawlessly, I appreciate the consistent communication. If I had another project, I would hire Prussia immediately and would recommend him to anyone.</p>
